# OneMe Identity
A path to self-sovereign identity.

## Your digital identity is broken.

The way current IT systems create and manage your identity is siloed and fragmented. We have separate credentials for every service we use -- from insurance, banking, vehicle registration, to emails -- yet we often use the same set of passwords for each of these hundreds of accounts. 

Each part of your fragmented identity is kept within servers containing millions of other identities, an attractive target for both hacking and misuse.

You retain no control over your identity, and companies spend millions maintaining and securing systems while regularly getting hit by privacy & fraud complaints, partner interoperability, and customer onboarding issues.

There has to be a better way.

## There is a better way.

OneMe Identity defragments your identity. It allows a userâ€™s multiple identities to be merged securely between organizations.

OneMe Identity is a decentralized identity management solution. It uses blockchain to ensure users maintain primary control of their identity.

OneMe Identity simplifies KYC requirements. It allows an organization to easily onboard customers and reduce costs by collaborating within an identity consortium.

OneMe Identity offers advanced authentication techniques. The solution includes multi-factor authentication with facial biometrics, fingerprints -- all verified on a private blockchain.
